## Essentials

Books that every programmer must have.

- [Head First Java](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596009205.do):
  **You do not know object-oriented programming** until you've read this book.
- [Head First Object-Oriented Analysis and Design](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596008673.do):
  **You do not know how to _apply_ object-oriented programming**
  until you've read this book.
  It covers the software design process and teaches skills sufficient to design
  any software system.
  You should also know
  [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design))
  and [GRASP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRASP_(object-oriented_design)).
- [Design Patterns (aka the Gang of Four book)](http://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented/dp/0201633612):
  A catalog of well-known solutions to common software design problems.
  A good summary of the book is on
  [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns).
  A summary of the patterns described here can be found at
  [http://www.oodesign.com/](http://www.oodesign.com/).
- [Head First Design Patterns](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596007126.do):
  Goes into greater depth on selected patterns.
  Some consider it better for learning and understanding patterns than the GoF
  book, which is more of a reference book than a study book.
