Hello, all! As promised, [here is the link to the Arch Linux VBox image that I demonstrated in Club today.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9kesbn97w6ul43l/Arch.ova?dl=0) A few things to note before you get started:

- This is the [official Arch Linux website. :)](https://www.archlinux.org)
- The [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org) is the first place to go if you have any questions about Arch. *SERIOUSLY! IT'S GREAT.*
- You will need [Virtualbox from Oracle. It's free.](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
- After running Virtualbox, select "Import Appliance" and choose Arch.ova (The file you just downloaded from here.)

##login info

|user|password|permissions|
|----|--------|-----------|

- After starting the system, to use log in as 'guest' with password 'password' and execute the command 'startx'. This will active the [X-Windows server](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xorg) and in turn, launch the [OpenBox window manager](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Openbox) GUI.
- 'pacman' is the default package manager for Arch. Check out its [page on the Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman) to learn more.
- To download a package, use the command ```pacman -S <package name>```
- To remove a package, use the command ```pacman -R <package name>```
- To update Arch, use the command ```pacman -Syu```
