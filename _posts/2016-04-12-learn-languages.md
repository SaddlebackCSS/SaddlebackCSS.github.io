Here's a list of useful websites for learning new programming languages.
These are **not** for beginner programmers, but if you are already comfortable
with one language, these will help you pick up new languages quickly.

- [Learn X in Y Minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/)
  contains cheat-sheets for several programming languages and tools.
- [Exercism](http://exercism.io/)
  contains practice problems for several programming languages.
  It uses a test-driven approach: you are given a set of automated tests,
  and you must write code to make the tests pass.
- [Daily Programmer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer)
  contains daily problems categorized as "Easy", "Intermediate", and "Hard".
  Users can post their solutions in any programming language.

It is also useful to search for programming contest sites, such as
[Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/),
[IPSC](http://ipsc.ksp.sk/),
and
[HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
([others here](http://www.dmoz.org/Computers/Programming/Contests/)).
