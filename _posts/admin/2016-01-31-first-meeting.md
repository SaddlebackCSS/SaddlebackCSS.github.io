The poll results are in! For Spring semester 2016, SCSS will be meeting **every Thursday from 4:30pm to 5:30pm in SM346, starting this Thursday, February 4th.**

The first meeting will be a general brainstorming session. Please come prepared to share any topics you'd like to learn about this semester. 

As a club we are required to send a representative once a month to the Inter-Club Council Meeting. The first ICC meeting will be at **2:00pm in SSC211 on February 4th.**
If you would like to volunteer to be the SCSS official club representative, please e-mail me before Thursday.

See you on Thursday!
