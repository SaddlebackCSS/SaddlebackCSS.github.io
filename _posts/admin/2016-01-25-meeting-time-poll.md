Hey guys. So we have a couple choices for meeting times this semester.
I have created a [strawpoll](strawpoll.me/6659198) so we can determine which time works best for the most people.
We would be meeting in SM346 because that room has computers for everyone, making it easy to present tutorials and have people follow along.
I also put an option to meet on Friday.

At the end of the week we will look at the results to determine our meeting time. 
If Friday is the most popular choice, we will hold an additional strawpoll to determine what time to meet on Friday.
I'll make an announcement on both the [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/SaddlebackCollegeCSS) and this page, letting everyone know the results.
We will have our first meeting next week.
