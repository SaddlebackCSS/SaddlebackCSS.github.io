I just found out that [OCLUG](http://www.oclug.org/) is having a presentation on Python this Saturday.

The Orange County Linux Users Group is a great place to interact with users of Linux and other Free/Open-Source Software.
Meetings are held one Saturday per month from 10:00am to 2:00pm at Cal State Fullerton (McCarthy Hall Room 606),
just off the 57 freeway at Nutwood.

(Parking and attendance are free!)
