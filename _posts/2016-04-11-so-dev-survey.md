Today I stumbled across the article
[The Difference Between C# to F# Is a Scale of $20K](https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2016/04/04/csharp-fsharp-salaries-stack-overflow.aspx),
and followed the link to the [Stack Overflow 2016 Developers Survey](http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016).
Here are some things I found interesting there.

- JavaScript is consitently the most popular technology in all categories.

  Java comfortably beat PHP and C# in that category.
