### Free Stuff for Students

  Normally $650! All you need is a college e-mail address.
- [Github Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack/):
  You have to apply for this and it takes a couple weeks, but it's basically a free 
  Github account upgrade. 5 free private repositories and a number of other products and features.
